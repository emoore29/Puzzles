# Puzzles/Leetcode

This repo is where I keep a record of my solutions to various small coding problems.

* **freeCodeCamp**: My answers to the challenges in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, which I completed in early 2023. This was before I had installed VS Code or used GitHub, and I was saving my answers as .txt files on my computer. Although I've checked some of the code and added comments to describe what each function should do, the main purpose of this is to have a record of my learning to look back on.
* I've also added my more recent solutions to FCC's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/#scientific-computing-with-python-projects) course.
* I've also saved some of my **Leetcode** solutions here so I can track my progress and refer back to old solutions to keep improving my programming skills.
