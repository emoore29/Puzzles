## freeCodeCamp

The files in the freeCodeCamp folder are my answers to the challenges in freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, which I completed in early 2023. This was before I had installed VS Code or used GitHub, and I was saving my answers as .txt files on my computer. I have started checking my code and adding comments to describe what each function should do, but it is a work in progress.

## LeetCode

I've decided to save my LeetCode solutions here so I can track my progress and refer back to old solutions to keep improving my programming skills.

## Project Euler

As with LeetCode, I've decided to use [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) to improve my problem-solving skills and track my solutions here.
